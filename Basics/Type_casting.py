# Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another

print(int(a) + int(b))   #string to integer conversion

# explicit_casting => dev does it 
# implicit_casting => python does it automatically

c=3.6
d=6

print(c + d)    # Output: 9 (float to integer conversion) implemented implicitly
